	<p>
		I, Mr. Nex, am a Hacker by trade, choice, and the forces of nature themselves. I've been programming since I was ~15 and I'm currently studying at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a degree in Game Design & Development with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science.

		My weapon of choice is the C programming language. I choose my poison to be Real Time Simulations, but more specifically creating powerful, reusable, accurate, and fast engines in which we can construct and run those simulations. While C is probably not most peoples preferred tools for creating simulation engines, I believe it offers advantages which outweigh those of more abstracted ones. C gives me the power and confidence to use a set of simple tools with which I create simple systems to perform complex tasks never once having my understanding of each statement obstructed even at the bit level.

	<p>
		I am a large proponent of Open Source Software and I do believe it will become the future of the tech industries. However, I have a conflicting ideology that sometimes it is very important to re-invent the wheel- even if you make an identical wheel. I believe this is necessary, not from a professional point of view, but as a scholar. I am one who learns by doing, so even when a resource is readily available for me to implement, I often like to define my own tool for the job to learn more about the concepts at hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics are a hobby of mine, oddly enough I really enjoy solving a challenging problem through my knowledge of maths. My preference and current interest lies within the algebras. I have a pretty extensive linear algebra background and within the next year I will begin moving into the modern & exterior algebra realms. Right along with this, I do very much enjoy the challenges of physics and physics programming.
