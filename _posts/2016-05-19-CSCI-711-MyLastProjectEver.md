title: CSCI-711 My Last Undergraduate Course Project Ever
---

What a strange time. As the year comes to an end, and I'm ready to move once again and start a new chapter of my life, I get to roll vicariously in the stress of my final projects. It is as such I am pleased to be creating the last component of the final project of my undergraduate career. It's also fitting that this project exploded from the linear algebra library I wrote during winter break of my freshman year.

I can't exactly tell you what this project has taught me. Over time I've used it as a context to learn everything from math to mechanics and overything in between. But most of all, it's taught me that working hard at something and dedicating time to a project really does pay off. And it's given me the confidence to foolishly believe I can accomplish just about any thing if I try hard enough for long enough.

Undoubtably this semester it's taught me everything I could have possibly dreamt of knowing about optics, materials, imaging science, and integrating over the universe. Most of my game development professors and peers haven't seen my work yet, but I sure hope I get a chance to show them before I leave-- especially the ones who saw the beginning of my game engine three years ago.

Well anyway, enough reminiscing, here is a link to the well needed project documentation:
