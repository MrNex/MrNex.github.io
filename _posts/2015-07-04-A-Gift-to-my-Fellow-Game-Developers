title: A Gift to my Fellow Game Developers
---

As many of you may or may not have read, I have been working in Research & Development under my professor Ph.D. David Schwartz at Rochester Institute of Technology this summer. I have been researching the most easily understood ways to implement various Game Physics topics, as well as developing a myriad of stand alone examples for fellow game developers to use as a resource or guide when implementing these topics. We currently have *a lot* of different examples, varying from ray tracing to 2D linear & angular collision resolution and this list is rapidly growing. Recently, my professor had went to a conference where he wanted to show what we were working on. My co-worker and I quickly moved a large quantity of the work to a [Github repository](www.github.com/MrNex/Game-Programming-Examples) where they are now publicly available for download. Those are not all of the examples, but there are quite a bit up there, and every day of the week we will be adding more (& more difficult) examples.

I will apologize in advance however, you must have visual studio to run the examples. This kills me inside, I would have loved to make these GCC compatible- but it would not have meshed well with the courses and faculty in my department at my school. Curses Microsoft! Restricting the audience of my work yet again!
