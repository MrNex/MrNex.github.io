title: CSCI-711 Texture Mapping
---

After a way-too-much fun spring break I am diving headfirst back into the grind this wonderful easter. The ray tracer now supports both procedural texture mapping, and texture mapping from an image! Enjoy some images of the progress.

I am also happy to report that the ray tracer is back to running in real time, and shadows can now be rendered from point lights as well. Furthermore, I've discovered I absolutely love OpenCL!

Happy Easter to whom it may concern!
