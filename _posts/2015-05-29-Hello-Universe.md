title: Hello Universe

GitHub kindly decided to make it really really easy to host a developer blog (Or any other kind of site I suppose, for that matter)! As such, it would be a crime if I didn't use it. The world is a small place, and with the advent of new technologies such as this it is quickly becoming smaller. To this I say, *Hello World* was a thing of the past when we couldn't actually say hello to the entire world with the imperceptible movement of your finger, therefore **Hello Universe**, I am MrNex.
