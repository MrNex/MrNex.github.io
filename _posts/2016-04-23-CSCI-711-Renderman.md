title: CSCI-711 Renderman
---

In my Global Illumination course, we had the opportunity to utilize Pixar's Renderman Shader Language, and prman for a project, if we so desired. I did choose to do this! The project was, given the following scene:

<figure>
<a href="/images/2016-04-23-Original.tif">
<img src="/images/2016-04-23-Original.tif">
</a>
<figcaption>The original image given as a base for the project</figcaption>
</figure>

I first had to modify all of the shaders to produce a distinctly different output:

<figure>
<a href="/images/2016-04-23-Modified.tif">
<img src="images/2016-04-23-Modified.tif">
</a>
<figcaption>My modified version of the scene</figcaption>
</figure>

Next, I had to replace the shaders entirely with my own:

<figure>
<a href="/images/2016-04-23-New.tif">
<img src="/images/2016-04-23-New.tif">
<figcaption>My version of the scene replaced by my original shaders</figcaption>
</figure>

I had a lot of fun with this assignment. At first I imagined Renderman was going to be a pain to learn, but before I knew it I was writing shaders with zero compilation errors and having a very fun time doing so.
