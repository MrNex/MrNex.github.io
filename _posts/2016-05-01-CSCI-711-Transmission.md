title: CSCI-711 Transmission

I write this post with extreme pride and minor disappointment. It is my displeasure to say I did not fully complete the latest assignment in my Global Illumination class in time. However, I solved all of my problems and in a few more hours of work it should be well all done! This is what I currently have complete:

As you can see, all of the trickiest things are working. Total internal reflection is detected (but not resolved yet), and I need to disregard (or mitigate) the shadows due to transmissive surfaces which should not be that hard either! I have to say, I am really amazed at the images I have been capable of generating throughout this semester. Although I've really been struggling to keep up with this course, and dedicating ~18 hours of work a day for the last 6 days straight (plus more casual work before that)-- I have to say I've learned more in this course than any other course since enrolling at Rochester Institute of Technology.

The knowledge I've gathered makes all of the stress & strain worth it by far-- and I couldn't be more proud to have minorly failed this assignment, because I've already come further in my graphics programming knowledge than I ever expected.
