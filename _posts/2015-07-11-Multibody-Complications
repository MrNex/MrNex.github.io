I knew it was only a matter of time. After the implementation of linear and angular collision resolution, friction, and rolling, the integrity of my NGen's physics resolution now falters when dealing with elastic collisions with 4 simultaneously colliding objects.

I am going to need to research techniques to properly solve multi-body collisions, but turns out it is a common and difficult problem which needs solving in many different fields of study. So far the only truly understandable implementation I found seemed extremely innefficient- the way it had worked is it solves the chain of connected collisions in different orders, then averages the results for each object. So simple, and turns out it works really well- but I'm not sure this is something I want the overhead of performing. I will also be looking into Featherstone's algorithm to see what I can find that might help.

Wish me luck! If anybody has any tips or links, please shoot me a message via my [GitHub](www.github.com/MrNex) or E-Mail me at npg3253@rit.edu!
