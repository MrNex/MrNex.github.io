title: Too Hurt To Program
---

My worst nightmare has finally come true. I'm actually *in too much pain to program*. On my way home from work Wednesday night I took a slam on my longboard. And by slam I mean my stomach hit a horizontal steel pole going very very fast. Shockingly enough- besides the bruises on my arms and stomach- it's my knee that is hurt.

I managed to dislocate my Patella and tear a few ligaments and boy is it painful. All I can manage to do is sit here and stare at nothing. The last few days have been horrible- hopefully things will turn up from here. The real dread? The trip home I need to make tomorrow from Rochester NY back to Long Island..

This is not going to be fun.
