title: CSCI-711 Project Proposal
---

Throughout my time in the Global Illumination course at RIT I will be working on a semester long project- this is the proposal for the project.

## What?

I would like to build a real time ray tracer into my game engine, [NGen (www.github.com/MrNex/NGen)]. This ray tracer should be able to render a low-mid object dynamic scene while still processing input, collision detection, object state/behaviors, and physics. It should be noted that while this scope seems large, everything besides the ray tracer is already implemented.

## Why?

As an undergraduate from the Game Design & Development program I have a strong interest in real time interactive applications. Furthermore, I have been devoutly working on NGen for ~3 years now and am currently on my third iteration of the project. One area of NGen I am still unsatisfied with is the rendering engine. The addition of a real time ray tracer could definitely fill that void!

## How?

I plan to use the C programming language along with OpenGL and OpenCL as needed to achieve my goal. I will also use the libraries which are apart of my NGen or which my NGen depends on.

## Who?

I, Nicholas Gallagher, would be working on this project alone.

Wish me luck!

## Update!
Since this post the project has been completed. A new post containing links to the project, documentation, and a video can be found at the following link:
