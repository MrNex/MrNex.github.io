title: Moving On, Moving Out
---

My summer working as a researcher at Rochester Institute of Technology is coming to an end. I really enjoyed this job. It was pretty much the ideal work for me. I wish I had more time to keep on at this- it's been amazing. I learned so many things and got so much practice doing what I love, but summer is coming to an end.

When one door closes another door opens. This fall I will be interning at General Electric Aviation as a Software something or other- I'm very excited. This will be my first time working for a big company such as General Electric. I'm looking forward to getting the feel of a larger atmosphere like that. However, I'm pretty nervous about one thing-- that they are going to make the mistake of not using my talents to the fullest potential.

I've read a lot about Software Internship experiences at General Electric Aviation. The biggest complaint is that the interns don't do any *real* work. Instead they get stuck with busy-work nobody else wants to do, like editing XML documents and what not. This makes me nervous for a few reasons- I hate web development, I hate busy-work, but most of all I would hate having the feeling of wasting time that I could have been at school studying.

Sure I will be getting paid pretty large sums of money, but to me knowledge is more valuable than any amount of money. I sure hope this opportunity at General Electric meets my expectations!

Along with finishing up one job and moving to another comes the whole routine of packing up and moving out. Boy is this stressful- while I'm trying to prepare for final exams and finish final projects for courses none the less! But one step at a time, eyes on the prize, soon I'll have a week to relax and it's off to my new apartment in Michigan! Time to get back to packing...
